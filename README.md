# Hades2 distribution

Hades2 is a free software distributed by RTE France to run load flow, security analysis, sensitivity computations and remedial actions simulations on a grid.

# License

RTE provides closed-source jars to integrate Hades to an application based on PowSyBl framework. Please read the complete software [license agreement](license.md).

Hades2 is distributed in the form of closed source because it is a legacy software that is not suitable for open source collaboration.

# Download

Hades2 is downloadable below for :
- [Linux (64 bits)](https://github.com/rte-france/hades2-distribution/releases/download/V6.4.0/hades2-V6.4.0.1.1-linux.tar.gz)
- [Windows (64 bits)](https://github.com/rte-france/hades2-distribution/releases/download/V6.4.0/hades2-V6.4.0.1.1-windows.zip)

# What's next ?

Our goal is to have also open source computation modules integrated to PowSyBl (load flows, time domain simulators, optimizers, etc.). This is however work in progress and we would welcome contributions in that field.

Please also note that a simple DC load-flow is currently being developed mainly for demo purposes. The code is in the repository [powsybl-incubator](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-incubator/tree/master/simple-loadflow).
